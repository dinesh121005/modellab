# Docker Containerization for DevOps React App

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Create .dockerignore file in devops/ to exclude unnecessary files from build context
- [x] Create Dockerfile in devops/ with multi-stage build (Node for building, nginx for serving)
- [ ] Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile
- [ ] Run the Docker container and test that the app serves correctly on port 80
- [ ] Verify the React app runs correctly in the container (check for any runtime issues)
